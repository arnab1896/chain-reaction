The objective of CHAIN REACTION is to take control of the
board by eliminating your opponent's elements.

It is a two player game. Players take it in turns to place
their elements in a cell. If an element is placed in a cell
with critical mass, the cell explodes into the surrounding
cells adding an extra element and claiming the cell for the
player. A player may only place the elements in a blank cell
or a cell that contains elements of his/her own colour. As
soon as a player looses all the elements the opponent wins.

CRITICAL MASS FOR THE CELLS :
	At the corners 	:  1
	At the edges  	:  2
	Inner cells     :  3
